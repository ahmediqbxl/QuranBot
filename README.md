# QuranBot
Automated QuranBot that will post daily on twitter, using the QuranAPI (https://alquran.cloud/api) and the twitter API.

First, you will need to create a Twitter developer account and get access to the Twitter API.

Next, you will need to write code that fetches a random verse from the Quran API. You can use a library like "Quran API" (https://alquran.cloud/api) to fetch the verses.

Then, you will need to write code to post the fetched verse to Twitter. You can use the Twitter API to post the verse as a tweet.

Finally, you will need to schedule your bot to run every day at a specific time. You can use a scheduling service like cron to do this.
